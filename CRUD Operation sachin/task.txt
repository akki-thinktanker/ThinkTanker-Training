Creating a CRUD application with Node.js that includes validation, role-based access control, file uploads using Multer, and sending emails (such as welcome and forgot password emails) involves several steps. 

Model Creation
Middleware for Validation and Role-based Access
Multer for File Uploads
Nodemailer for Sending Emails
CRUD Operations

1. Model Creation(DONE)
- Define Mongoose models for your resources. At least create a User model with fields for name, email, password, role (admin, user, etc.), and profile image.
- Use bcryptjs to hash passwords before saving them to the database.

2. Middleware for Validation and Role-based Access (DONE)
- Create validation schemas using Joi or express validation for different operations (e.g., user registration, login).
- Implement middleware to check a user's role before allowing access to certain routes.

3. Multer for File Uploads 
- Set up Multer to handle file uploads, particularly for user profile images.
- Configure storage options to define where files should be stored and what they should be named.

5. Nodemailer for Sending Emails
- Configure Nodemailer with your email service provider.
- Implement functions to send welcome emails after user registration and forgot password emails when requested.

6. CRUD Operations
- Implement CRUD operations for your resources. For the User model, this includes registration, login, updating user details, and deleting users.
- Ensure that operations like updating and deleting user details are protected and only accessible by the user themselves or an admin.

Additional Notes
1. Error Handling: Create a error handling mechanism to send meaningful error responses to the client.
2. Environment Variables: Use environment variables to store sensitive information like database connection strings, JWT secret keys, and email service credentials.



Creating a well-organized folder and file structure is crucial for maintaining and scaling your Node.js application efficiently, especially for a project with CRUD operations, validation, role-based access, file uploads, and email functionality.
