I encountered two unexpected errors during my project, but I managed to resolve them. Sharing this in case it helps someone else:

1) When using the .env file for sensitive information like a secret key, I initially masked it using asterisks (***********). However, this caused an 'Invalid Signature' error. The fix was to ensure the secret key not in asterisks format.

2) I faced issues while setting up the MONGODB_URI. Adding the query parameters ?retryWrites=true&w=majority resulted in an error, preventing the creation of my database collection. Removing these parameters resolved the issue.

Hope this insight saves someone else valuable time and frustration! Thank you for sharing your experiences.
